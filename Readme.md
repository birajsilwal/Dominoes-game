# Domino

- This version of the game uses 28 pieces of dominos and assumes two players.

### How to play

- The game starts with all the dominos being placed face down on the table and mixed around.  This is called the boneyard.
- Each player selects 7 dominos and places them on the long edge so as to be able to see them without being visible to the opponent.
- One player starts the game by downing (putting down) a domino face-up on the table.
- The players take turns.
- On  each  turn,  the  player  downs  a  single  domino  matching  the  configuration  on  the table.
- If the player does not have a domino able to extend the line of play, they must pick one up from the boneyard and must continue to do so until a matching domino is found or the boneyard is empty.
- If the player has a domino able to extend the line of play, they cannot pick any pieces from the boneyard.
- If the boneyard is empty and the player cannot extend the line of play, they end their turn.
- The game ends when the boneyard is empty and either
  * The current player places their last domino.
  * Both players have taken a turn without placing a domino.
- At the end of the game, the dots on each player’s dominos are counted and the player with the lower total wins.  (This means that is one player ends the game without any dominos, they’re pretty much guaranteed to be the winner.)
  If both players have the same number of dots, the player who last played a domino is the winner.
